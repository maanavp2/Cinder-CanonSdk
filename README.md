Cinder-CanonSdk
===============

Cinder wrapper for the Canon Digital EOS SDK v2.13. Tested only on Mac OS X.
Created at Red Paper Heart by Charlie Whitney, Jamie Kosoy and Adri√† Navarro.      
Based on ofxCanon by Diederick Huijbers and ofxEdsdsk by Kyle Mcdonald.

Installation
------------
1. Clone the block into your addons folder
2. Register as Canon developer and download the SDK from any of the following sites:
    - [Canon USA](http://consumer.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/digital_rebel_xt?fileURL=ps_sdk_form&pageKeyCode=downloadLicense&id=0901e02480057a74_1&productOverviewCid=0901e0248003ce28&keycode=Sdk_Lic)
    - [Canon Europa](https://www.didp.canon-europa.com/)
3. Unzip the file then based on your platform:
   - MAC: open the .dmg and copy the folder called EDSDK into the *lib/* folder of the addon.
   - WIN: open the .zip and (if building x64) copy folders from EDSDK_64 into *lib/EDSDK* folder of the addon. (if building x86 copy from the EDSDK folder) 
4. Create a new project with Tinderbox, either starting from scratch or using the template.
5. TO FIX: if you get a *Library not loaded* error when starting the app, go to the Copy Files section of Build Phases and select *Frameworks* from the Destionation dropdown menu. Trying to figure out how to include this in the tinderbox config xml.

Usage
------
For basic usage, create a *CanonCamera* object, call setup() at the beginning and start and stop liveView as you want. You'll need to update it every frame. With *getLiveSurface()* you can process the image and draw it in a more flexible way than doing *camera.draw()*.

To get a callback when a photo has been taken your app will need to subclass *canon::PhotoHandler* and implement three delegate methods: *photoTaken(), photoDownloaded()* and *photoDirectory()*, as shown in the example.

For advanced usage you can get an instance of the *CinderCanon* class from the CanonCamera, and send specific commands to the device. There's also an experimental recording mode that hasn't been tested, and some placeholders for upcoming functionality.
